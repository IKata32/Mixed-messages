# Inspiration Mixed Message Generator

A Node.js application that generates personalized inspirational messages. Each time you run the program, you'll receive a new, randomized motivational message to brighten your day.

## Features

- **Randomized Output**: Every message is uniquely generated from hundreds of possible combinations
- **Three-Part Structure**: Each message includes:
  1. A greeting (e.g., "Hello", "Hi", "Greetings")
  2. A nickname (e.g., "Champ", "Superstar", "Friend")
  3. A motivational phrase (e.g., "you're doing amazing things!", "keep pushing forward!")
- **Interactive Mode**: Answer prompts to receive multiple messages in one session
- **Local Execution**: Runs entirely on your machine - no internet connection required

## Installation

No additional dependencies required - this uses only Node.js built-in modules.
